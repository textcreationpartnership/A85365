         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p> 
               <hi>His Highneſſe,</hi> according to his day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cuſtome, (a cuſtome not ſo pleaſing unto us, being too venterſome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate for ſuch a <hi>Generall,</hi> whoſe life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, is the preſervation of our Church and State) <hi>I</hi> ſay, hee being in perſon upon Munday the firſt of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> in the approaches, to view the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries which were to bee brought over the Mote of <hi>Rapenburch,</hi> as then not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and that under the favour of twelve Demi-Canons conſtantly playing, and innumerable Muſquet ſhot, having beene there three houres, was about to goe away: when upon a ſuddain a great ſhout was made by the enemy, caſting up their hats and crying for a <hi>Parley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>His Highneſſe,</hi> remaining in the unfiniſhed Gallarie; preſently two Captaines of the enemy, one a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> bearing the Order of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the other an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> were ſent out <hi>Hostages</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <hi>Highneſse,</hi> and a <hi>Dutch</hi> Captaine under the Regiment of Colonell <hi>Ferens,</hi> and a <hi>French</hi> Captaine under the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154759:3"/>of Colonell <hi>de Straides,</hi> (having at that time the guard) were ſent by his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> reciprocall <hi>Hoſtages</hi> into the <hi>Towne;</hi> and that very ſame night the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were on both ſides agreed upon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which the <hi>Towne</hi> and <hi>Forts</hi> ſhould be ſurrendred.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hoſtages</hi> being demanded what the reaſon was they delivered over the <hi>Town</hi> ſo ſoon, and ſo ſuddainly, gave no other Anſwer; But that when wee firſt entred the Town, we ſhould ſee they had juſt reaſons ſo to doe. But ſome others an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that although they might have kept it ten or twelve dayes longer; yet that time ſhould but adde unto their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that muſt ſee before their eyes the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuccourable extremities of their ſick and maimed ſouldiers, deſtitute of Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Chyrurgiry and Medicaments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without all hope of any reliefe.</p>
            <p>But the moſt able ſaid, it was becauſe they wereſo aftoniſh'd to ſee the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was in ſo ſhort a time ſo far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and that accordingly, they feared
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154759:4"/>to bee on a ſuddaine ſurprized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Excellency</hi> of <hi>Brederoede, Marſhall</hi> of the Field, had alſo that night taken two Sconces, which ſeparated the Town from the Sconce St. <hi>Anthony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that every one doth wonder, and it is no wonder they ſhould wonder, that ſo ſtrong a place, being ſituated in the midſt of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and Dedicated unto the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary,</hi> and therefore called <hi>Propug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naculum inex pugnabile,</hi> (The inexpugnable Fortreſſe) as they themſelves doe write in the Volume of <hi>Flanders,</hi> in which all their Towns and Fortreſſes are delineated ſhould be taken in ſo ſhort a time. But it is the very hand of <hi>God,</hi> and that through indefatigable Vigilancy, Induſtry, the vaſt Wiſedome, and incomperable Valour of his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> which hath brought this work about.</p>
            <p>During the time of Treaty, and after, we ſhewed unto the Earle of <hi>Megen,</hi> as alſo unto divers French Officers of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience, that were come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to that purpoſe, our Approaches, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154759:4"/>all the out-works: which they bleſſed themſelves, and admired at; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed never to have ſeen the like; ſuch ſtrong works, and made in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
            <p>The Enemy marched out <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the ſeventh of <hi>September,</hi> new ſtile, with about 1080 men, with forty Colours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three Regiments, that of <hi>Don Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no de Gomero,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Megen,</hi> and Col: <hi>Royers;</hi> the reſt were of the ordinary Garriſon, beſides the ſick and others upon Waggons, amounting in all to 1500.</p>
            <p>We found within the Town above 50 left behinde moſt miſerably burnt and maimed, ſo that they could not be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: unto whom his <hi>Highneſse</hi> (as Mereifull as Martiall) being this day in the <hi>Towne,</hi> ſent his Chyrurgions to dreſſe and cure them.</p>
            <p>We are moſt bound to render all due thanks and praiſe for this great and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected <hi>Victory</hi> unto the <hi>Almighty,</hi> the <hi>Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
